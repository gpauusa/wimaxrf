Parts of Click are distributed under different licenses. The
specific licenses are listed below.

    drivers/e1000*, etc/linux-*-patch, linuxmodule/proclikefs.c: These
portions of the Click software are derived from the Linux kernel, and
are thus distributed under the GNU General Public License, version 2.
The GNU General Public License is available via the Web at

    include/click/bigint.hh: This portion of the Click software
derives from the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library, and is
thus distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version
3. This license is available via the Web at
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html>. The LGPL specifically permits

    Element code that uses only Click's interfaces will *not* be
derived from the Linux kernel. (For instance, those interfaces have
multiple implementations, including some that run at user level.)
Thus, for element code that uses only Click's interfaces, the BSD-like
Click license applies, not the GPL or the LGPL.
